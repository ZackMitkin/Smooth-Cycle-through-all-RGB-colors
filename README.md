# Smooth-Cycle-through-all-RGB-colors

Very simple little thing, and I am happy with how it looks.

Inspiration came from Microsoft Windows 8 and 10 install screens when the install finishes and it does those "preparing desktop" and "setting up apps"

I thought it looked nice, and my version is not as clean looking and is very slow and pretty boring, but I suggest changing speed before you compile and try yourself.
